# Brain Stroke Prediction Model
## Introduction:
This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying individuals at risk of experiencing a brain stroke. By analyzing demographic, lifestyle, and medical data, the goal is to create a reliable tool that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention strategies. With accurate predictions, medical resources can be allocated more efficiently, and interventions can be implemented to reduce the incidence of brain strokes and improve patient outcomes. In this project, various classification algorithm will be evaluated to find the best model for the dataset

Main Features:

Stroke Risk Prediction: Utilizing supervised learning algorithms such as kNN, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGradient Boosting, this feature aims to develop predictive models to forecast the likelihood of an individual experiencing a brain stroke accurately.
Feature Selection and Engineering: Identifying and refining relevant features from demographic, lifestyle, and medical data to enhance model accuracy and interpretability. This process enables the optimization of preventive measures and resource allocation in healthcare settings.
Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employing visualization techniques and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and correlations within the data, providing insights into factors contributing to stroke risk.

Feature Engineering: Handling outliers and missing values, feature selection, encoding, and scaling.

Model Selection and Training: Exploring various machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing models for stroke prediction.

Model Evaluation and Validation: Rigorous evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques to assess model performance and ensure reliability in real-world applications.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning model parameters to optimize predictive accuracy and generalization ability across different datasets and scenarios.


Results:
The tuned SVM model demonstrates superior effectiveness for hospitals to predict the possibility of brain stroke compared to other algorithms tested in this project. The recall score for the train and test set are 0.89 and 0.62 respectively. Although its goodness of fit is still overfitting, especially when we are applying the model for healt-related purposes, it still showed that there are room for improvement and SVM is the preffered model for this dataset. The overfitting issue relies on the fact that we conduct oversampling data balancing procedure. The ratio between sick and healthy people is too sparse, causing the SMOTENC to generate over 4400 data points based on only 250 available data points. This might cause the model to be able to learn the train set exceptionally well as there are over 4700 data with similar natures as they were generated by SMOTENC. In addition, SVM's drawback lies in its resource-intensive nature, with time and memory consumption increasing linearly with dataset size.
